# asteroidsGame

Hello and welcome to my game of Asteroids!
First, you have to install the ncurses library!
After installation, it is a lot easier to run it.
Enter the directory named "asteroids game - term 3 project".
You have to compile it with the simple command "gcc -o asteroids asteroidsGame.c -lncurses".
NOTE: it is a lower case L not an I! I know it is confusing...
After compiling the game, you just have to type one more simple command in order to run it and it is "./asteroids".

HAVE FUN and see if you can beat my highscore!
    NOTE: my actual highscore is 3200, but I lowered it in order to prove that the score is savable.

You are more than welcome to take a look at my code and see behind the magic.
I added comments in order to make it easier to follow.
